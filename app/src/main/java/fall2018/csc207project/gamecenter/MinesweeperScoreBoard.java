/**
 * A scoreboard that calculates scores when receiving a solved minesweeper game.
 * Short elapsed times and a greater proportion of mines contribute to higher scores.
 *      Time translates into a score, based on a tiered system.
 *          < 10 seconds is a perfect score. (100)
 *          30 - 10 seconds is a shallow increase in score. (90-100)
 *          90 - 30 seconds is a noticeable increase in score. (
 *          > 90 seconds is a shallow drop. ( 90s = 30 )
 *      Bombs are a multiplier, with 20% of the board being covered by mines equating to a 100%
 *          multiplier. Scales linearly down to 0% at 0 mines, and upwards to 200% at 100% mines.
